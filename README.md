# Working-with-Callbacks
## Creating a neural network : 

**1. Choose a Neural Network Architecture:**

Select an appropriate architecture based on the nature of the problem. Common choices include feedforward networks (e.g., Multi-Layer Perceptrons), convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for images, and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for sequences.
Model Design:

**2. Define the neural network's layers,** including input and output dimensions, activation functions, and regularization techniques (e.g., dropout, batch normalization).
   
**3.Compile the Model:**

Specify the loss function that measures the difference between predicted and actual values.

**4. Choose an optimizer** (e.g., Adam, SGD) to adjust the model's weights during training.

**5. Select evaluation metrics** (e.g., accuracy, mean squared error) to monitor model performance.
**6. Training:**

Feed the training data through the network and adjust the weights to minimize the loss.
Use the validation set to monitor overfitting and fine-tune hyperparameters.
Evaluation and Testing:

**7. Assess the model's performance** using the testing set, considering the chosen evaluation metrics.
Visualize and analyze the model's predictions and any misclassifications.
**8. Iterate and Refine:**
Adjust the model architecture, hyperparameters, or data preprocessing based on insights from the evaluation process.
Train the model again to observe improvements.
